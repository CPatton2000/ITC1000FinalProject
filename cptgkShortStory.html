    <div id="storyDiv">
        <p id="shortStory">I can’t get this tune out of my head. Every time I close my eyes it’s there; a sonorous hum that would drive any sane man mad with its low whine, just out of earshot, but always there. It wouldn’t give me a moment’s rest, no matter how much I wished it to. It felt as though it had embedded itself in me, claiming me as host to its viscous melody. Ever since that bastard William hooked me up to that machine. Yes, this was his fault. ‘It would only be for a few moments,’ he assured me, and I trusted him. I handed him my life on a silver platter and for what? I’m not even sure. It’s too dark to see. I can barely move. All I can do is think about William. <br> <br>

            That bastard always cherished his little contraptions. If I had half the mind as I do now, I would have put an end to that once in for all. I remember the first time I had seen him ‘experimenting’. He had a live rat under some sort of ring, electric currents ran through tubes and zapped the poor thing. The smell was atrocious, a mix of sulfur and burnt flesh. I was curious, if not revolted, but I wished to understand just what the hell I had walked in on. He claimed it was an experiment on ‘genetic mutation’, whatever that meant. Days turned into weeks, then into months. I was his partner in crime… until we had no more subjects left. I always thought we were <br> <br>

            I had forgotten how long I had been in this basement of his. That was where I was, right? I can’t remember. Ever since our, no, HIS last experiment, something hasn’t felt right. The room is pitch black. I thought I was still in his basement, but it feels much larger than I remember, smells much too sterile. Perhaps he had it cleaned while I was unconscious? Was I unconscious? It feels like I just woke up, but how long ago had I been asleep? Wait a moment. That melody. It’s gone! I had not noticed until now, but it was finally gone! My mind was alight once more. I could think again. I could remember! Suddenly, a noise to my left. William? I tried to call out but my voice was much too strained and whatever came out of my mouth almost sounded inhuman. I felt the vibrations along the metal ground floor as something heavy dropped, then it was as silent as it has always been. Wait, William didn’t have metal floors. <br> <br>

            My confusion was cut short as I caught the scent of what had dropped against the floor. Meat. It was fresh, very fresh. I was suddenly so hungry. I crawled to the smell and immediately partook in the meal. Cool blood oozed between my teeth as I tore out the meat from bone. I knew not the taste, but it was a godsend. My meal was left ravaged and soon I was content… but now what? I needed to find the breaker box and turn on the lights. Find William. I didn’t know where to start. A crackle sounded above me. Some sort of speaker? William didn’t have a speaker system. The harsh crackle turned into a soft hum. I felt my body relax against the smooth metal floor. What a nice melody… surely I had heard it before, but I can’t for the life of me remember where. It was so soothing and I felt so tired. Perhaps William could wait a little longer. I could use the nap. </p>
